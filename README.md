# CreatureGeneticAlgorithm
Second AI assignment from my computer science degree.
For this assignment we were given a spec for what the different aspects of the genes were, and then we were asked to build a full version of the system, including a gui interface.
This project was written in java, and only requires the standard libraries.
To run this, you need to call the PlayGod program, and then input the requested values.
